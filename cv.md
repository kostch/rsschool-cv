## About Me
I am 24 years old, and I decided to change my life by connecting it with programming! :smile:  
I like to solve various problems that make me think.  
I chose the path - I started programming in my free time, because I like doing it, it makes my head work, and it's cool!  
In addition to programming, I like to spend time actively: cycling, skating, skiing.
